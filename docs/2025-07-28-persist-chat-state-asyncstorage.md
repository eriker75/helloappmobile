# Persist Chat State and Message Details in AsyncStorage

**Date:** 2025-07-28

## Objective

Persist the state of chats and message details in AsyncStorage to improve user experience, leveraging the existing chat store.

## Plan

1. Analyze the current Zustand chat store implementation.
2. Integrate AsyncStorage to persist the `chats` array (and possibly avatar loading state).
3. On app start, hydrate the store from AsyncStorage.
4. On state change (e.g., setChats, updateOtherUserProfile), persist the new state to AsyncStorage.
5. Ensure transparent integration with the rest of the app.
6. Update documentation and devlog after implementation.

## Files to Modify

- `src/modules/chat/stores/chat.store.ts`
- (Potentially) any files where the chat store is initialized or used

## Observations

- The chat store currently manages chat and avatar state in memory only.
- No persistence is implemented yet.
- AsyncStorage is the standard for React Native state persistence.
- Must ensure no regression in real-time updates or UX.

## Implementation

- Integrated AsyncStorage into the Zustand chat store to persist the `chats` array.
- On app start, the store hydrates from AsyncStorage using a new `hydrate` method and `useHydrateChatStore` hook.
- On state change (setChats, updateOtherUserProfile), the updated chats are saved to AsyncStorage.
- The chat list screen now calls `useHydrateChatStore` to ensure instant chat state on app open.
- No changes were needed for message repository/service, as message state is managed by react-query and Supabase.

## Status

- Completed
