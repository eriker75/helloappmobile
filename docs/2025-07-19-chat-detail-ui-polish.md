# Chat Detail UI Polish

**Date:** 2025-07-19

## Objective

Refactor the chat detail screen (`app/dashboard/[chatId]/index.tsx`) to closely match the provided reference image, achieving a modern, clean, and user-friendly chat interface.

## Action Plan

1. Analyze and reuse existing UI primitives from `components/ui/` (e.g., Avatar, Box, Text, HStack, VStack).
2. Implement a header with the contact's name and avatar.
3. Render a scrollable list of chat bubbles:
   - Left-aligned (other user): white background, dark text.
   - Right-aligned (current user): blue background, white text.
   - Rounded corners, proper spacing, and max width.
   - Emoji and icons as needed.
4. Add a date separator ("Hoy") as in the reference.
5. Add a message input bar at the bottom:
   - Rounded input field.
   - Send button (icon).
6. Use mock data for messages.
7. Ensure the design is modular, maintainable, and visually matches the reference.

## Files to Modify

- `app/dashboard/[chatId]/index.tsx` (main implementation)

## Observations

- All UI primitives are available in `components/ui/`.
- No existing chat bubble or input bar component; will implement inline for now.
- Will use mock data for demonstration.
- No backend or real-time logic in this task; focus is on UI only.

## Result

- The chat detail screen (`app/dashboard/[chatId]/index.tsx`) was fully refactored to match the provided reference image.
- The UI now features:
  - A modern header with avatar and contact name.
  - A scrollable list of chat bubbles, with left/right alignment, color, and spacing as in the reference.
  - A date separator ("Hoy").
  - A rounded message input bar with a send button.
- All UI primitives were reused from `components/ui/` and the code is modular and maintainable.
- Mock data is used for demonstration.
- No backend or real-time logic was implemented; focus was on UI only.
